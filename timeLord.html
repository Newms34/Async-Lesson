        <h2>Time Complexity</h2>
        <p>Time complexity is a complex (hah!) subject, but here's the basic gist:
            <br/>
            <ol>
                <li>Take some sort of operation. For this example, I'll pretend I'm asking my friends Bob, Bill, Betty, and Bianca to a party.</li>
                <li>Let's assume that I can only set a crucial detail of the party - how much pizza I need to order - after I know <i>everyone's</i> responses.</li>
                <li>We saw in <a href="./index.html">Async</a> two ways to do this:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Callback Hell</li>
                        <li>Promises</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>But there's a THIRD way!:
                    <pre>//We are, of course, assuming a lot of the following functions/URIs exist
//buyPizza() is, surprisingly, not a valid JS function
var numResp = 0;//number of responses obtained
var resps=[];//the responses themselves
var friends = ['bob','bill','betty','bianca']
var getResp = function(){
	$.get('addressOf'+friends[numResp],function(thisResp){
		resps.push(thisResp);
		numResp++;
		if(friends[numRespsi]){
			//still more friends, so keep goin!
			getResp();
		}else{
			//everyone responded!
			buyPizza(resps.length);
		}
	})
}
getResp();//start it off!
</pre>
                </li>
                <li>Why didn't I suggest this method? Well, this uses something called recursion, wherein the function basically calls <i>itself</i>. This pushes another 'copy' of the function onto the call stack, and means our browser now needs to keep track of that function, PLUS the 'child' function, and so on.</li>
                <li> So recursion isnt' good!</li>
            </ol>
        </p><hr/>
        <p class='confooz'><i>Still confused? Let's look at a simpler example:</i>
            <ol>
                <li>I've got an array <pre>var myBeasts</pre> of objects <pre>{}</pre>where each object represents a beastie &#128006;.</li>
                <li>Each object has a <pre>target</pre> property that indicates which of the other beasties &#128006; it's targetting.</li>
                <li>I run a simulation in which the beasties &#128006; interact.</li>
                <li>Each time the simulation clock 'ticks', I need to do the following:
                <pre>
for (var i=0;i&gt;myBeasts.length;i++){
	//loop thru ALL beasts
	for (var j=0;j&gt;myBeasts.length;j++){
		if (myBeasts[j].name = = myBeasts[i].target) {
			doInteraction();//assume this, i dunno, checks how far apart they are or something
		}
	}
}
</pre>
                </li>
                <li>So, what's the issue here? Well, consider that for any number of organisms <i>n</i>, we need to run <i>n<sup>2</sup></i> loop iterations. That's gonna end up being a large number, very quickly. From <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_complexity" target='_blank'>wikipedia</a>:
                <cite>"the amount of time taken by an algorithm to run as a function of the length of the [...] input"</cite>
                </li>
                <li>When we're programming, we want to aim for the <i>lowest</i> time complexity possible. Some examples of different complexities:
                <ul>
                	<li>O(1): Time to complete operation does not change depending on the input. Assuming the basal function is quick, this is usualy ideal (but not always possible!)</li>
                	<li>O(n): For any number of inputs <i>n</i>, the time to complete the operation increases linearly. So if 1 item takes 1 second, and 2 items take 2 seconds, then 3 items takes 3 seconds, and so on.</li>
                	<li>O(log(n)): For any number of inputs <i>n</i>, the time to completion increases by the logarithm of <i>n</i>.</li>
                	<li>O(n<sup>2</sup>): For any number of inputs <i>n</i>, the time to completion increases by the square of the input. My beasties &#128006; example above is O(n<sup>2</sup>).</li>
                	<li>O(k<sup>n</sup>) (where <i>k</i> is some constant): For any number of inputs <i>n</i>, the time to completion increases by some number <i>k</i> raised to that number. This kinda function increases time complexity very quickly, so it's very undesirable (unless there are no other reasonable choices!).</li>
                </ul></li>
